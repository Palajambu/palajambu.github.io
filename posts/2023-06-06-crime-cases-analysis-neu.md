## **Motivation**

This project is part of my application process to The Data School Information Lab - Germany. After reviewing one my portfolio <a href="https://nuki-susanti.github.io/data%20analysis/data%20science/machine%20learning/2023/01/10/road-crash-analysis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Road Crash Analysis</a>, they decided to proceed to the final step. They provided me an already cleaned data to work with and asked me to analyze and build a dashboard out of it using Tableau. No coding work is needed.
<br />
To be honest, I was (always) a bit lost when deciding a layout or design of the dashboard. Then, it was out of nowhere that I came up with newspaper looking-like dashboard. I did enjoy the analysis that occupied my whole weekend, however, I definitely have to work harder in the design!
